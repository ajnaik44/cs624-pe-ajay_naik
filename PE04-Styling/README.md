# Input
The app shows a collection of profiles containing profile image, name, occupation, and a brief description. 
This data is stored in an array named data containing multiple profile entries.

# Process
The primary component is ProfileCard. ProfileCard receives individual profile details as props and renders these details in a styled card layout. 
The card contains sections for image, name, occupation, and a description. 
It is touch-enabled to toggle between showing a thumbnail or a zoomed in view.

# Output
The output is a set of profile cards, each displaying the profile image, name, occupation, and description in a stylized layout. 
The cards are arranged in a view, and they respond to touch events by toggling the thumbnail/full view mode.

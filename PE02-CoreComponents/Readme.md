**Input**
The majority of the program's input comes from user interactions. The programme records the text input from users as they enter their preferred course in the available input area. Additionally, the "./assets" directory must contain the "icon.png" image file that the programme demands. The user's course selection and the image file are the two inputs that the programme needs to run properly.

**Process**
The primary role of the programme is to display content on the screen. To organise and present information, it makes use of the fundamental elements of React Native, including View, Text, ScrollView, Image, and TextInput. An arrow function is used to represent the functional component, which contains the program's logic.

The programme allows for customising of the shown data by retrieving the user's preferred course from the input field and dynamically displaying it on the screen.


**Output**
A graphically organised and stylish mobile app interface is produced by the programme. A title, subtitle, headings, list of courses, links, and an input area for their preferred course are displayed to users. Additionally, the output follows the stated styling guidelines for things like font sizes, colours, and a scrollable layout, which improves the user experience in general. The programme also gives users access to CityU's course catalogue via a link, allowing them to access outside data. In conclusion, the programme produces a user-friendly mobile app that displays MSCS courses and gives users the option to customise the information shown about the courses.

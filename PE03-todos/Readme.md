**Input**
The program is a mobile task management app developed using React Native. It allows users to input tasks by entering them in a text input field and clicking the "Submit" button. Users can also edit tasks by clicking the "Edit" button associated with each task and marking tasks as done with the "Done" button. The input consists of tasks provided by the user.

**Process**
The program's main logic is implemented in React Native components. It uses state management to keep track of tasks, the current task being edited, and task completion status. When a user inputs a task and clicks "Submit," the program checks whether the task is a new one or an update to an existing task, and accordingly, it updates the task list. When a user clicks "Done," the program marks the associated task as completed. The program also provides options to filter tasks into three categories: "ALL," "ACTIVE," and "COMPLETED."

**Output**
The program displays tasks in a user-friendly interface, showing their text, completion status, and offering actions like editing, marking as done, and deletion. The "ALL," "ACTIVE," and "COMPLETED" buttons enable users to filter tasks based on their completion status.

This report describes how the program manages input, processes the tasks, and provides a user-friendly output.
